# minitraining
A small app to help training alone for a specific exercise
Mainly made for my own use...
The exercise: put down 4 different coloured signs (options given in app)
in 4 directions in equal ditance from the middle,
run towards colour created by the app and return to the middle as fast as possible,
till the timer finishes
